\chapter{Correlation rules and proposed extension}
\label{cap:proposed-solution}

\noindent A state of the art skin detection method has been recently developed by~\cite{brancati:17}. In this chapter, we review the method and extend it\footnote{All the implementations can be found at \url{https://bitbucket.org/rodrigoadfaria/skin-detector/}.} adding more rules to enforce the constraints and seeking for a better accuracy in terms of false positive rate without hurting the performance of the original method.

\section{Correlation rules on YCrYCb colormap}
\label{sec:correlation_rules_ycrycb}
The pixels of human skin have a very particular color. They fall into a restricted range of hues and they are not deeply saturated. This phenomenon is due the appearance of skin: formed by a combination of blood (red) and melanin (brown, yellow), which leads the human skin color to be clustered within a small area in the color space~\citep{fleck:96}.

Although this cluster can be seen in different color spaces, authors often use those where it is possible to split the chrominance from the luminance information. YCbCr is one of these color spaces. \citet{chai:99}~firstly observed this cluster within this particular color space (see Fig.~\ref{fig:dataset_sfa_ycbcr}). Based on a given set of training images, they~\citep{chai:99} built a skin color map using a histogram approach. In this map, the Cr and Cb distributions of skin color fall into the ranges [133, 173] and [77, 127], respectively, regardless the skin color variation in different races (see Fig.~\ref{fig:dataset_sfa_ycbcr_hist}).

\end{figure}

Therefore, a very simple and practical approach to detect human skin pixels would be to create a set of rules, based in those ranges, that identify the presence of chrominance (Cr, Cb) values who fit into the rules. In fact, this was the approach used by~\citet{chai:99}.

Another important finding regarding the skin color clusters in the YCbCr color space is their behavior when looking for Cb and Cr channels distribution with respect to the Y luminance component separately. In other words, where rely this distribution into the YCb and YCr subspaces. In Figure~\ref{fig:obama_trapezoids}, we can see the distribution (clusters) for an image of the Pratheepan dataset. We can clearly see their geometry as a trapezoidal shape~\citep{hsu:02}.

In fact, the skin color pixels distribution in the YCb and YCr subspaces is a pattern. However, this trapezoidal shape and size will change according to many factors. \citet{brancati:17} observed that change and identified that they are caused mainly due illumination conditions (i.e. the lighting of the scene when the image was acquired influences the size, height, and position of these trapezoidal shape). Moreover, they~\citep{brancati:17} observed an inversely proportional behavior of the chrominance components (Cr, Cb) that could be fitted into a model for skin pixels detection. We will explain in details how this model has been created in Section~\ref{sec:original_method}.

\section{Original method}
\label{sec:original_method}
In order to describe the proposed extensions, we will first present the original method that is based on the definition of image-specific trapezoids, named $T_{YCb}$ and $T_{YCr}$, in the \textit{YCb} and \textit{YCr} subspaces, respectively. The trapezoids are essential to verify a relationship between the chrominance components $Cb$ and $Cr$ in these subspaces~\citep{brancati:17}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{trapezoids}
    \caption[Graphical representation of the trapezoids as well as its parameters]{Graphical representation of the trapezoids as well as the parameters $Y_{min} = 0$, $Y_{max} = 255$, $Y_{0}$, $Y_{1}$, $Y_{2}$, $Y_{3}$, $Cr_{min}$, $Cr_{max}$, $Cb_{min}$, $Cb_{max}$, $h_{Cr}$, $h_{Cb}$, $H_{Cr}(P_Y)$, $H_{Cb}(P_Y)$. Source: adapted from~\citep{brancati:17}.}
    \label{fig:trapezoids}
\end{figure}

To show the correlations, Brancati et. al. present the YCbCr space as a 2D graph where the $Y$ is presented in the abscissa and the $Cr$ and $Cb$ components is in the ordinate (see Fig.~\ref{fig:trapezoids}). The base of the trapezoids $T_{YCr}$ and $T_{YCb}$ are given by the coordinates $(Y_{min}, Cr_{min})$ and $(Y_{min}, Cb_{max})$ in the $YCr$ and $YCb$ , respectively~\citep{brancati:17}. The values $Cr_{min}$ = 133, $Cb_{max}$ = 128 were selected according to~\citet{chai:99} where a skin color map was designed using a histogram approach based on a given set of training images. Chai and Ngan observed that the Cr and Cb distributions of skin color falls in the ranges [133, 173] and [77, 127], respectively, regardless the skin color variation in different races (see details in Section~\ref{sec:correlation_rules_ycrycb}).

The $Cr_{max}$ parameter is calculated dynamically, taking into account the histogram of the pixels with $Cr$ values in the range $[Cr_{min}, 183]$, looking for the maximum value of $Cr$ associated with at least 0.1\% \footnote{In \citet{brancati:17} this rate is reported to be equal to 10\%. However, in the distributed source code we found the value 0.1\%, that we are using in the experiments.} of pixels in the image. The same applies to $Cb_{min}$, taking the histogram with $Cb$ values in the range $[77, Cb_{max}]$. $Y_0$ and $Y_1$ (shorter base of the upper trapezoid) are, respectively, the 5${th}$ and 95$th$ percentile of the luminance values associated with the pixels of the image with $Cr = Cr_{max}$~\citep{brancati:17}. A similar procedure is used to find the values of the shorter base of the other trapezoid, $Y_2$ and $Y_3$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:crmax_computation} for an example).

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{crmax_computation}
    \caption[Computation of $Cr_{max}$ based on $Cr$ values histogram of a 724 x 526 image]{Computation of $Cr_{max} = 162$ based on $Cr$ values histogram of a 724 x 526 image. Source: adapted from~\citep{brancati:17}.}
    \label{fig:crmax_computation}
\end{figure}

The correlation rules between the chrominance components $P_{Cr}$ and $P_{Cb}$ of a pixel $P$ are defined as~\citep{brancati:17}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the minimum difference between the values $P_{Cr}$ and $P_{Cb}$, denoted $I_P$;
    \item an estimated value of $P_{Cb}$, namely $P_{Cb_s}$;
    \item the maximum distance between the points $(P_Y, P_{Cb})$ and $(P_Y, P_{Cb_s})$, denoted $J_P$.
\end{itemize}

Therefore, to determine if $P$ is skin, the following equations must hold~\citep{brancati:17}:
\begin{equation}
    P_{Cr} - P_{Cb} \geq I_P
\label{condition_c0}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
   |P_{Cb} - P_{Cb_s}| \leq J_P
\label{condition_c1}
\end{equation}

The estimated value $P_{Cb_{s}}$ is given by \footnote{$dP_{Cb_{s}}$ is the distance between the points $(P_Y, P_{Cb_{s}})$ and $(P_Y, Cb_{max})$ in the $YCb$ subspace, calculated on the basis of $dP_{Cr}$, observing the inversely proportional behavior of the components. $\alpha$ is the rate between the normalized heights of the trapezoids in relation to the $P_Y$ value~\citep{brancati:17}.}:
\begin{equation}
    P_{Cb_s} = Cb_{max} - dP_{Cb_s}
\end{equation}
where \footnote{$dP_{Cr}$ is the distance between $(P_Y, P_{Cr})$ and $(P_Y, Cr_{min})$ points in the $YCr$ subspace~\citep{brancati:17}.}:
\begin{align}
    dP_{Cb_s} &= \alpha \cdot dP_{Cr}
    \\
    dP_{Cr} &= P_{Cr} - Cr_{min}
\end{align}

The coordinates of the other sides of the trapezoids are given by $[P_Y, H_{Cr}(P_Y)]$ and $[P_Y, H_{Cb}(P_Y)]$, such that~\citep{brancati:17}:
\begin{align}
  H_{Cr}(Y) &=  \begin{cases}
                Cr_{min} + h_{Cr}\big(\frac{Y - Y_{min}}{Y_0 - Y_{min}}\big) & Y \in [Y_{min},\ Y_0] \\
                Cr_{max} & Y \in [Y_0,\ Y_1] \\
                Cr_{min} + h_{Cr}\big(\frac{Y - Y_{max}}{Y_1 - Y_{max}}\big) & Y \in [Y_1,\ Y_{max}]
              \end{cases}
\\
  H_{Cb}(Y) &=  \begin{cases}
                Cb_{min} + h_{Cb}\big(\frac{Y - Y_2}{Y_{min} - Y_2}\big) & Y \in [Y_{min},\ Y_2] \\
                Cb_{min} & Y \in [Y_2,\ Y_3] \\
                Cb_{min} + h_{Cb}\big(\frac{Y - Y_3}{Y_{max} - Y_3}\big) & Y \in [Y_3,\ Y_{max}]
              \end{cases}
\end{align}

\noindent where $h_{Cr} = Cr_{max} - Cr_{min}$ and $h_{Cb} = Cb_{max} - Cb_{min}$, which are the heights of $T_{YCr}$ and $T_{YCb}$, respectively.

The computation of those points are useful for the calculation of $\alpha$. We first compute the distances $\Delta_{Cr}(P_Y)$ and $\Delta_{Cb}(P_Y)$ between the points $(P_Y, H_{Cr}(P_Y))$, $(P_Y, H_{Cb}(P_Y))$ and the base of the trapezoids~\citep{brancati:17}:
\begin{align}
    \Delta_{Cr}(P_Y) &= H_{Cr}(P_Y) - Cr_{min} \\
    \Delta_{Cb}(P_Y) &= Cb_{max} - H_{Cb}(P_Y)
\end{align}

Next, the distances are normalized with respect to the difference in size of the trapezoids \citep{brancati:17}:
\begin{align}
  \Delta^{'}_{Cr}(P_Y) &=  \begin{cases}
                \Delta_{Cr}(P_Y) \cdot \frac{A_{T_{YCb}}} {A_{T_{YCr}}} &\quad \text{if}\ A_{T_{YCr}} \geq A_{T_{YCb}} \\
                \Delta_{Cr}(P_Y) &\quad \text{otherwise}
              \end{cases}
\\
  \Delta^{'}_{Cb}(P_Y) &=  \begin{cases}
                \Delta_{Cb}(P_Y) &\quad \text{if}\ A_{T_{YCr}} \geq A_{T_{YCb}} \\
                \Delta_{Cb}(P_Y) \cdot \frac{A_{T_{YCr}}} {A_{T_{YCb}}} &\quad \text{otherwise}
              \end{cases}
\end{align}
where $A_{T_{YCr}}$ and $A_{T_{YCb}}$ are the areas of trapezoid ${T_{YCr}}$ and ${T_{YCb}}$, respectively.

Then, the value of $\alpha$ is given by~\citep{brancati:17}:
\begin{equation}
    \alpha = \frac{\Delta^{'}_{Cb}(P_Y)} {\Delta^{'}_{Cr}(P_Y)}
\end{equation}

Finally, $I_P$ and $J_P$ are given by~\citep{brancati:17}:
\begin{equation}
    I_P = sf \cdot [(\Delta^{'}_{Cr}(P_Y) - dP_{Cr}) + (\Delta^{'}_{Cb}(P_Y) - dP_{Cb_s})]
    \label{eq:ip}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    J_P = dP_{Cb_s} \cdot \frac{dP_{Cb_s} + dP_{Cr}} {\Delta^{'}_{Cb}(P_Y) + \Delta^{'}_{Cr}(P_Y)}
    \label{eq:jp}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
    sf = \frac{min( (Y_1 - Y_0), (Y_3 - Y_2) )} {max( (Y_1 - Y_0), (Y_3 - Y_2) )}
\end{equation}

\section{Extended method}
\label{sec:proposed_method}
The hypothesis defined in the original method is based on rules that an estimated value of the point $P_{Cb}$, namely $P_{Cb_s}$, must hold in order for the correlation to be valid. On the basis of the inversely proportional behavior of the chrominance components, we will rewrite the correlation rules with respect to the $P_{Cr}$ point.

Thus, we have to refactor the correlation rules to put them in terms of the estimated value of $P_{Cr}$, that we denote as $P_{Cr_s}$ \footnote{$dP_{Cr_s}$ is the distance between the points $(P_Y, P_{Cr_s})$ and $(P_Y, Cr_{min})$ in the $YCr$ subspace, calculated on the basis of $dP_{Cb}$, observing the inversely proportional behavior of the components. $\alpha$ is the rate between the normalized heights of the trapezoids in relation to the $P_Y$ value.}:
\begin{equation}
    P_{Cr_s} = dP_{Cr_s} + Cr_{min}
\end{equation}
where \footnote{$dP_{Cb}$ is the distance between $(P_Y, P_{Cb})$ and $(P_Y, Cb_{max})$ points in the $YCb$ subspace.}:
\begin{equation}
    dP_{Cr_s} = \alpha \cdot dP_{Cb}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    dP_{Cb}   = Cb_{max} - P_{Cb}
\end{equation}

Next, the constraints given by $I_P$ and $J_P$ in the Eq. \ref{eq:ip} and \ref{eq:jp} respectively, can be redefined as:
\begin{equation}
    I^{'}_P = sf \cdot [(\Delta^{'}_{Cr}(P_Y) - dP_{Cr_s}) + (\Delta^{'}_{Cb}(P_Y) - dP_{Cb})]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    J^{'}_P = dP_{Cr_s} \cdot \frac{dP_{Cb} + dP_{Cr_s}} {\Delta^{'}_{Cb}(P_Y) + \Delta^{'}_{Cr}(P_Y)}
\end{equation}

Therefore, to determine if the pixel $P$ is skin, we have to modify the conditions given by Eq. \ref{condition_c0} and \ref{condition_c1}:
\begin{equation}
    P_{Cr} - P_{Cb} \geq I^{'}_P
\label{condition_c00}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
   |P_{Cr} - P_{Cr_s}| \leq J^{'}_P
\label{condition_c11}
\end{equation}

Doing this simple extension, we are now able to apply the method to the same sets of images to evaluate, in fact, the inversely proportional behavior of the chrominance components. More than that, we can combine all these constraints, given by the pair equations \ref{condition_c0} and \ref{condition_c1}, \ref{condition_c00} and \ref{condition_c11}, to reinforce the firstly defined hypothesis.

\end{figure}

\section{Neighborhood extended method}
\label{sec:neighborhood_extended_method}
Both methods presented in Sections~\ref{sec:original_method} and \ref{sec:proposed_method} can be applied to detect skin pixels, either separated or in a conjunction rule. However, skin pixels do not usually appear isolated and we could improve the method using some of the already processed neighbors of a pixel $P$, in order to decide if $P$ represents human skin, or not.

To do that, let $N_8^-(P)$ be the 8-\textit{neighbors} of $P$ that can be reached before $P$ when scanning the image in raster order~\citep{rosenfeld:66}. We can see this idea graphically represented by the blue points in Figure~\ref{fig:pixel_neighborhood}.

Thus, we classify $P$ as skin in the following manner: if the constraints given by the pair of equations \ref{condition_c0} and \ref{condition_c1}, as well as \ref{condition_c00} and \ref{condition_c11} hold, then $P$ is classified as skin. When only one of the conditions is satisfied, then we check the decision in $N_8^-(P)$. If three or more pixels are skin, then $P$ will also be classified as a skin pixel. Figure~\ref{fig:n8-flowchart} shows a flowchart of the aforementioned procedure described.

\section{Heuristics to fix neighborhood extended method}
\label{sec:sup_neighborhood_operations}
The neighborhood extended method presented in Section~\ref{sec:neighborhood_extended_method} will end up with an undesired behavior on the output images that we called \textit{diagonal effect} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:diagonal_effect}). In addition, besides being visually undesirable, the \textit{diagonal effect} phenomenon causes us to have an increase in the false positive rate. This is caused due to the shape of the window being used. Once we look only for the four already seen pixels of the 8-\textit{neighbors} window, the operation is so based in a non-symmetry mask. Ideally, we could use another neighborhood strategy and look for all the eight neighbors of the pixel $P$ being evaluated. However, this particular implementation can add extra computational time and hurt the performance of the method. 

Therefore, we created an adaptation of the neighborhood method shown in Section~\ref{sec:neighborhood_extended_method}. In this version, we basically scan the image, with a size of $W \times H$, in the raster order, and apply the original and the extended reverse rules for every single pixel. We keep the both results in a matrix of the same size ($W \times H$) of the input image. For each coordinate of this output matrix, we will have a two positions vector with the result of the original and reverse rules answer for this pixel. Next, we read each position of this output matrix and we apply a 8-\textit{neighbors} operations in four different ways:

\begin{enumerate}[label={(\arabic*)}]
    \item we look in the rules answer performing an AND. In other words, if both original and reverse rules are saying this pixel is skin, then we classify it as skin;
    \item we look in the rules answer performing an OR. In other words, if one of the rules (original or reverse) is saying this pixel is skin, then we classify it as skin;
    \item we look in the neighbors only querying the original ($P_{Cb_s}$) rules;
    \item we look in the neighbors only querying the reversed ($P_{Cr_s}$) rules.
\end{enumerate}

Of course, this variation will add some additional computational cost once we will scan the image one more time. This implementation can be enhanced, but the idea here is to only explore better the connectivity of the 8-\textit{neighbors} window and check, on the basis of a symmetric mask window, if the \textit{diagonal effect} is gone as well as the measures are improved. Some experiments can be seen further in Section~\ref{sec:sno_experiments}.

    \caption[Image samples with the diagonal effect after the neighbors method segmentation]{Image samples with the diagonal effect after the neighbors method segmentation. Each image is from (top-down) SFA, Pratheepan, HGR, and Compaq datasets, respectively, where: (a) original image (b) ground truth (c) combined method (f) neighbors method. Independently of the classification accuracy, we can clearly see the diagonal effect present in the output of the neighbors method segmentation in comparison with combined. Besides being a visually undesirable effect, this phenomenon causes us to have an increase in the false positive rate.}
