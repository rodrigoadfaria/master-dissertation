\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{cap:experimentos}

In this section we present some experimental evaluations of the proposed extensions along with the original method in three widely known datasets: SFA, Pratheepan and HGR. In addition, a brief definition of the evaluation metrics used is shown for the sake of clarity.

\section{Datasets}
\label{sec:datasets}

\subsection{UCI}
\label{sec:datasets_uci}
Named UCI in this work, this dataset was proposed by~\citet{uci-skin-dataset:12} and obtained from the machine learning repository of the University of California in Irvine \citep{lichman:13}. The dataset consists of images of various skin and non-skin textures obtained from thousands of arbitrary faces images of different ages, sex and races \citep{pal-texas:04, feret:96}.

The UCI contains 245,057 samples, composed of 3 attributes that constitute the input vector $x = [x_1, x_2, x_3]$, $x \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$, where $d$ is the space dimension which represents, respectively, blue (B), green (G) and red (R) channels of the RGB color model. In addition, a fourth column determines the class to which the sample $x$ belongs, denoted by $y$, where $y \in Y$ and $Y = \{+1, -1\}$. In other words, each sample is an RGB pixel with a given label.

The table~\ref{tbl:uci_dataset} exemplifies a short excerpt from the UCI database. It is worth mentioning that of the 245,057 samples, 194,198 are non-skin pixels and 50,859 pixels with different skin tones. In addition, the images that were used to extract the dataset were not made available by the authors.

The fourth column is the label assigned to the sample, which can assume +1 if it is skin and -1, otherwise. Originally, the class representing a non-skin pixel had value 2, replaced by -1 for compliance with the experiments.}

Since the data are points in the RGB space, it is possible to plot it for a better interpretation of them, as shown in the figure~\ref{fig:dataset_uci}.

\end{figure}


\subsection{SFA}
\label{sec:datasets_sfa}
SFA, the name of the dataset proposed by \citet{sfa-skin-dataset:13}, stands for Skin of FERET and AR Database. The SFA is a set of images of frontal faces obtained from two other color image databases: the FERET, created by~\citet{feret:96}, and the AR proposed by~\citet{ar-face-database:98}, which provided 876 and 242 images each, respectively. It is important to notice that AR images have a white background and small variations of skin color. In other words, the environment is more controlled than the images in FERET \cite{sfa-skin-dataset:13}. Figure~\ref{fig:sfa_dataset_exemplo} shows some of the 1,118 samples available.

\citet{sfa-skin-dataset:13} also extracted different window patches of each skin and non-skin samples to facilitate future research. The samples were randomly generated considering the ground truth mask \footnote{Ground truth is the term used to denote an image whose point of interest is properly segmented and highlighted, discarding the remaining pixels giving them uniform colors.} of each image, being three samples of skin and five of non-skin. Each sample is a window of size $n \times n$, where $n$ is odd, with a central pixel, from which other sample sizes have been created, ranging from $1 \times 1$ to $35 \times 35$, as can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:sfa_dataset_janelas}.

First row are the original images and the second contain the colored ground truth with the skin color pixels annotated manually. The black color RGB = (0, 0, 0) was assigned to all pixels in the background. In the third row we have the binary ground truth images. We generated these samples based on the colored ground truth, by creating a mask, assigning (255, 255, 255) for the pixels which were not background (0, 0, 0). One can see some noise in the results, but the samples were enough for further experiments. In addition, the original images were not perfectly annotated. Therefore, some salt noise can be seen in non-skin regions. Source: \citet{sfa-skin-dataset:13}.}

\end{figure}



\subsection{Pratheepan}
\label{sec:datasets_pratheepan}
The images in the Pratheepan dataset were downloaded randomly from Google for human skin detection search. There are 78 images of family and face captured with a range of distinct cameras using different color enhancement and under different illumination conditions \cite{tan:12}. Figure~\ref{fig:pra_dataset_exemplo} shows some of the 78 samples available.

    \label{fig:pra_dataset_exemplo}
\end{figure}


\subsection{HGR}
\label{sec:datasets_hgr}
The database for Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR) contains the gestures from Polish and American Sign Language. There are 1,558 images acquired in different conditions of background, dimensions and lightening. In addition to original and ground truth binary skin mask images, it includes hand feature points location in separate files. Figure~\ref{fig:hgr_dataset_exemplo} shows some of the 1,558 samples available \citep{kawulok:14, nalepa:14, grzejszczak:16}.


\begin{figure}[H]

Source: \citet{kawulok:14, nalepa:14, grzejszczak:16}.}
    \label{fig:hgr_dataset_exemplo}
\end{figure}

The images within were acquired in three different series. A set of 899 was captured in uncontrolled background and lighting. A small set of 85 was obtained in gray (44) and (41) uncontrolled background; the lighting was uniform. The third group contains 574 images in controlled background (green tone), using uniform lighting conditions \citep{kawulok:14, nalepa:14, grzejszczak:16}.


\subsection{Compaq}
\label{sec:datasets_compaq}
Compaq can be considered as the first large skin dataset and, probably is the most used for skin detection classifiers. It consists of 13,635 images crawled from the Internet, which 4,670 contain skin regions and another subset of 8,965 images not containing any skin. The ground truth images are poorly annotated on the basis of an automatic software tool \citep{mahmoodi:16}.

It is worth mentioning that this database is no longer available and we had obtained a copy of it by contacting the authors. We also had to fix some few images due lack of ground truth or files corrupted. The final amount of images with skin used in the experiments is 4,669. Figure~\ref{fig:compaq_dataset_example} shows some of the 4,669 samples available used in the experiments \citep{jones:02}.

\section{Evaluation measures}

\textit{Precision, Recall, Specificity} and \textit{F-measure} have been used as evaluation metrics. They are the same used in~\citet{brancati:17} to compare the performance with state-of-the-art methods. They are also widely used by the scientific community. These metrics are given by the following formulas:

\begin{equation*}
    Precision = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
    \label{eq:precision}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
    Recall = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
    \label{eq:recall}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
    Specificity = \frac{TN}{TN + FP}
    \label{eq:specificity}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
    F-measure = 2 \times \frac{Precision \times Recall}{Precision + Recall}
    \label{eq:fmeasure}
\end{equation*}

where TP, TN, FP, FN are, respectively, the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative pixels counted in the image, which are obtained from the confusion matrix (see table~\ref{tab:confusion_matrix}).

\begin{table}[hb]
    \centering

    \begin{tikzpicture}[
    box/.style={draw,rectangle,minimum size=2cm,text width=1.5cm,align=center}]
    \matrix (conmat) [row sep=.1cm,column sep=.1cm] {

        label=left:\( \textbf{skin} \),
        label=above:\( \textbf{skin} \),
        ] {True \\ Positive};
    &
    \node (fneg) [box,
        label=above:\textbf{non-skin}] {False \\ Negative};
    \\
    \node (fpos) [box,

\section{Machine learning experiments}
\label{sec:ml_experiments}
Preliminary experiments were carried out using machine learning techniques in order to establish a bottom line for comparison with the proposed method, mainly in the execution time point of view.

The first experiment was carried out with $k$-NN and SVM, available in the scikit-learn package~\citep{scikit-learn:11}. The color space originally used was RGB, as cited in the description of datasets in \ref{sec:datasets}. In both cases, the chosen cross-validation strategy was 10-fold, which is a common choice of this approach in practice \citep{mostafa:12}. In addition, the technique of grid search of scikit-learn was also used with the objective of finding the most suitable parameters for each classifier.

The grid search is used in scikit-learn to find the optimal parameters of a classifier when they can not be learned by the estimator, such as the \emph{kernel} and $\gamma$ in the SVM or number of neighbors of $k$-NN \citep{scikit-learn:11}. The parameter tables used in the training of SVM and $k$-NN can be seen in \ref{tab:svm_grid_search} and \ref{tab:knn_grid_search}. The parameters of each line are combined in an attempt to find the optimal estimator. For example, a choice in SVM training would be \emph{kernel} = rbf, C = 100, $\gamma$ = 1e-4. All possible combinations are exploited, with the best of them being returned~\citep{scikit-learn:11}.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{small}
\setlength{\tabcolsep}{10pt}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline

poly   & 1 & 10 & 100 &      & 1e-4 & 1e-5 & 3 & 4 \\ \hline
linear & 1 & 10 & 100 &      &      &      &   &   \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\end{small}
\caption[Grid search table of the parameters of the optimal estimator in the SVM]{Grid search table of the parameters of the optimal estimator in the SVM. The kernel column refers to the kernels used in training that are Gaussian, polynomial and linear, respectively. C is a regularization parameter that tells SVM the amount of error allowed during the training. Gamma is a parameter used only in Gaussian and polynomial kernels, as cited in~\ref{sec:classifiers_svm}. Degree is the degree of the polynomial; used only in the polynomial kernel~\citep{scikit-learn:11}.}
\label{tab:svm_grid_search}
\end{table}

3 & 5 & 9 & 15 & 25 & 31 & 35 & distance & uniform & auto \\ \hline

\end{tabular} 
\end{small}
\caption[Grid search table of the parameters of the optimal estimator in k-NN]{Grid search table of the parameters of the optimal estimator in k-NN. The n\_neighbors column refers to the number of neighbors considered in the training. Weights is the weight function used in the prediction, where uniform indicates that the points have equal weights and distance indicates that the inverse of the distance is applied in the classification, as cited in~\ref{eq:knn_funcao_peso}. The third column indicates which algorithm should be used; auto means that the algorithm will be decided based on the data~\citep{scikit-learn:11}.}
\label{tab:knn_grid_search}
\end{table}

The results of this experiment can be seen in the table~\ref{tab:results_experiment_one}. The dataset used was UCI. It is noteworthy that the training was performed splitting the data with 30\% randomly separated for test in both classifiers.
\begin{table}[!htpb]
\centering
\begin{small}
\setlength{\tabcolsep}{8pt}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline
 \thb{Classifier} & \thb{Color model} & \thbi{Precision} & \thbi{Recall} & \thbi{F-measure} \\ \hline
 $k$-NN & RGB & 0,9995 & 0,9995 & 0,9995 \\ \cline{1-5}
 SVM    & RGB & 0,9995 & 0,9995 & 0,9995 \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\end{small}
\caption[Results of the experiments with $k$-NN and SVM in the UCI dataset]{Results of the experiments with $k$-NN and SVM in the UCI dataset. The optimal $k$-NN parameters found during the training in UCI were $n\_neighbors = 3$, $weights = uniform$. In the case of SVM, the optimal parameters found in UCI training were $kernel = rbf$, $C = 100$ and $gamma = 1e-3$.}
\label{tab:results_experiment_one}
\end{table}


As can be seen in the table~\ref{tab:results_experiment_one}, both classifiers had very high quality measures in the UCI dataset, close to 100\%, which is probably an over-fitting situation. One possible root cause is the splitting of training and test data subsets. We observed that there are many replicates among the samples, so it is possible that samples already seen by the classifier during the training are used in the test step.

In fact, once we used a seed to generate the subsets, we applied the same strategy to split the data and count how many samples of the test subset were seen in the training subset as shown in figure~\ref{fig:uci_split_representation}. Based on the distribution of the splitting and the results of the measures given in table~\ref{tab:results_experiment_one}, we can say that UCI dataset is not suitable for this application.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figuras/uci_split_representation}

    \caption[UCI samples distribution after splitting the dataset in training and testing subsets]{UCI samples distribution after splitting the dataset in training and testing subsets. We used the scikit-learn package function for splitting, where 30\% is the size of test set.

Source: proposed by the author.}
    \label{fig:uci_split_representation}
\end{figure}

For the benefit of the doubt, we submitted the learned function given by those classifiers in real images of Pratheepan and SFA datasets. This experiment can help us to understand the ability of the learned model to generalize for upcoming non seen samples.

\section{Rule-based experiments}
\label{sec:rule_based_experiments}
\noindent In this section we present some experimental evaluations of the proposed extensions described in sections~\ref{sec:proposed_method} and \ref{sec:neighborhood_extended_method}, as well as the original method in  four widely known datasets: SFA, Pratheepan, HGR and Compaq. The latest three of them have also been used in~\citet{brancati:17}.

Table~\ref{tab:merged_rules_results} shows quantitative result metrics of the experiments. Column 1 refers to the dataset used. Column 2 refers to the method being experimented: Original for the original hypothesis;  Reverse refers to the reverse hypothesis with respect to $P_{Cr_{s}}$ parameter; Combined refers to the combination of both of the former methods (see  Sec. \ref{sec:proposed_method}); Neighbors refers to the extension of the method using the neighborhood approach (see  Sec. \ref{sec:neighborhood_extended_method}).

\section{Results and Discussion}

\noindent The original method was compared with six well known rule-based methods in literature using four different datasets, three of them, HGR, Pratheepan and Compaq, have also been used here. 

Because the method had the best \textit{F-measure} in the HGR and Pratheepan datasets in comparison with the other six methods and, in addition, because it performed the top first \textit{Precision} in HGR and  second in Pratheepan, we decided to compare the proposed extensions only to the original method.

Table~\ref{tab:merged_rules_results} shows quantitative result metrics of the experiments. Column 1 refers to the dataset used. Column 2 refers to the method being experimented: Original for the original hypothesis;  Reversed refers to the reverse hypothesis with respect to $P_{Cr_{s}}$ parameter; Combined refers to the combination of both of the former methods (see  Sec. \ref{sec:proposed_method}); Neighbors refers to the extension of the method using the neighborhood approach.

As one can see, the reverse hypothesis performed better than the original method and achieved the best \textit{Recall} in HGR and SFA. It also achieved the best \textit{F-measure} in SFA with a 0.8125 rate, which gave almost 0.25 in gain compared to the original.

In general, the reverse method increased the \textit{Recall} but did not perform well in \textit{Precision} and \textit{Specificity} measures. When we combined both methods, the best \textit{Precision} and \textit{Specificity} were achieved for all datasets but it loses some performance in \textit{Recall}. However, it has very high \textit{F-measure} rates.

The combined method along with the neighborhood approach achieved the best \textit{F-measure} in HGR and Pratheepan. Moreover, the other metrics still are in a very high rate for all datasets, being in the top second in almost cases.

Therefore, the combined and extended approaches are very competitive compared to the original method. Furthermore, all the variations of the original method are still computed in quadratic time, maintaining the desired computational efficiency that are useful in different application domains, mainly near real time systems (processing time of about 10ms for a typical image of dimensions 300x400).
