\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cap:introducao}
The study and understanding of human skin color date from many years ago. \citet{edwards:39} were one of those who tried to precisely analyze the color formation of this particular material by means of spectrophotometry. Spectrophotometry consists of the measurement of the light reflected at each wave-length (color) of the visible spectrum. The curve obtained can be transformed by computation into a specification of the color in terms of its three definite attributes, namely, dominant wave-length, purity, and brightness.

According to \citet{edwards:39}, skin is built from a series of different layers (see Fig.~\ref{fig:human-skin-layers}), each of which reflects a portion of impinging light, after absorbing a certain amount of it by the pigments which lie in the layer. The light which is neither reflected nor absorbed, however, is transmitted through each successive layer to the underlying one, where absorption, reflection, and transmission again take place. The absorption bands of the pigment in each layer are thus "imprinted" on both the reflected and transmitted light from each layer. The total reflected light, consequently, has the absorption characteristics of the pigments in all the layers. This phenomena gives rise to what our eyes see as skin color.

\citet{edwards:39} observed yet that other pigments out of melanin and hemoglobin also play a role in the origin of skin color, along with an additional optical effect, designated as scattering. The pigments are melanoid -- derivative of melanin --, oxyhemoglobin, and carotene. Furthermore, they stated that variations in the amount of melanin in the epidermis is responsible for the difference in human skin coloration.

Later, \citet{anderson:81} provided an integrated review of the transfer of optical radiation into human skin. They~\citep{anderson:81} noticed that the epidermis provide an optical barrier, primarily by absorption of Ultra Violet (UV) radiation, and to a lesser degree, by optical scattering. In addition, the dermis should be considered a turbid tissue matrix with which optical scattering largely defines the depth of penetration of various wavelengths radiation.

In fact, there are evidences that human skin pigmentation is an adaption for the regulation of penetration of UV radiation into the epidermis. As populations moved to parts of the world with different UV radiation levels, they underwent genetic changes that modified their skin pigmentation, a necessary fine tuning which made it possible for them to tan easily~\citep{jablonski:00}. Tanning is the ability to develop temporary melanin pigmentation in the skin in response to UV radiation and has evolved numerous times in peoples living under highly seasonal patterns of sunshine~\citep{jablonski:10}.

Therefore, a natural evolution of the skin coloration has been occurred to accommodate the physiological needs of humans as they have dispersed to regions of widely varying annual average UV radiation~\citep{jablonski:10}. This observation led~\citet{chaplin:04} to design a model to correlate the skin reflectance to seasonal UV radiation levels and other environmental variables, with the aim of determining which variables contributed most significantly to skin reflectance. The UV radiation data recorded by satellite were combined with environmental variables and data on human skin reflectance in a geographic information system (GIS). These were then analyzed visually and statistically resulting in a predicted map of skin color reflectance (see Fig.~\ref{fig:skin-ref-map}).

We can clearly see darker shades of skin near the Equator and tropics due exposition to high UV radiation. This is a very singular feature of human skin, once it acts as a sun shield to protect the body from solar UV radiation~\citep{jablonski:04}. The large number of shades of skin shown in the map give us an idea on how complex can be a system to automatically detect human skin in images.

Skin detection can be defined as the process of identifying skin-colored pixels in an image. It plays an important role in a wide range of image processing and computer vision applications such as face detection, pornographic image filtering, gesture analysis, face tracking, video surveillance systems, medical image analysis, and other human-related image processing applications.

The problem is complex because of the numerous similar materials with human skin tone and texture, and also because of illumination conditions, ethnicity, large number of shades, sensor capturing singularities, geometric variations, etc. Because it is a primary task in image processing, additional requirements as real time processing, robustness and accuracy are also desirable.

It is worth mentioning that image processing is one of the most important tasks in a computer vision system. Its goal is to create a suitable description -- typically based on shapes, textures, gray levels or color -- with enough information to differentiate the objects in the scene. With this description, useful interpretation can be extracted from the image by means of an automatic computer system that facilitates human perception.

There is no general agreement among authors regarding where image processing stops and computer vision starts. The first, as the title says, processes the image by applying some transformations on it which will produce a more enhanced and readable image. In addition, the input and output of the process are always images. On the other hand, computer vision has the ultimate goal to use computers to emulate human vision, including learning and the ability to make inferences and take actions based on visual inputs~\citep{gonzalez:02}. In general,
computer vision systems benefit from image processing techniques as pre-processing steps to build better applications. Thus, we can see that they definitely are not different fields, but there is an overlapping between them.

Once this work is intended to explore new methods on human skin detection, we will use techniques from both fields. Color space transformation from image processing, for example, as well as human skin segmentation and understanding as part of computer vision. This is a tentative to imitate the human visual system and its capability to recognize others from the same specie â€“- of course, humans use other characteristics to identify other humans like shape, high, gender, and others, but skin is also part of this recognition system.

One of the powerful features used of this task is definitely skin color, which is a strong attribute and it is used in most algorithms for skin detection. It is normally used along with other features such as shape, texture, and geometry, or even as a preliminary step to classify regions of interest in an image.

The human skin color pixels have a restricted range of hues and are not deeply saturated, since the appearance of skin is formed by a combination of blood (red) and melanin (brown, yellow), which leads the human skin color to be clustered within a small area in the color space~\citep{fleck:96}.

Color has the ability of functioning as a descriptor that often simplifies the identification and extraction of an object in a scene. Moreover, the ability of humans to discern thousands of tonalities and intensities compared to only a few dozen levels of gray, put the color as a strong candidate feature in computer vision and image processing applications~\citep{gonzalez:02}.

The human perception of colors occurs by the activation of nerve cells that send signals to the brain about brightness, hue and saturation, which are usually the features used to distinguish one color from another~\citep{gonzalez:02}.

The brightness gives the notion of chromatic intensity. Hue represents the dominant color perceived by an observer. Saturation refers to the relative purity or amount of white light applied to the hue. Combined, hue and saturation are known as chromaticity and, therefore, a color must be characterized by its brightness and chromaticity~\citep{gonzalez:02}.

Colors can be specified by mathematical models in tuples of numbers in a coordinate system and a subspace within that system where each color is represented by a single point. Such models are known as the color models (or color spaces)~\citep{gonzalez:02}.

The choice of a color space is also a key point of a feature-based method when using skin color as a detection cue. Due to its sensitivity to illumination, the input image is, in general, first transformed into a color space whose luminance and chrominance components can be separate to mitigate the problem~\citep{vezhnevets:03}.

For the case of skin detection methods there are, basically, three approaches: rule-based, machine learning based and hybrid. They differ in terms of classification accuracy and computational efficiency. Machine learning and hybrid methods require a training set, from which the decision rules are learned. Such approaches outperform the rule-based methods but require a large and representative training dataset as well as it takes a long classification time, which can be a deal breaker for real time applications~\citep{kakumanu:07}.

In this work we propose an improvement of a novel method on rule-based skin detection that works in the YCbCr color space~\citep{brancati:17}. Our motivation is based on the hypothesis that the original rule can be complemented with another rule that is a reversal interpretation of the one proposed originally. Besides that, we also take in consideration that a skin pixel does not appear isolated, so we propose another variation based on neighborhood operations. The set of rules evaluate the combinations of chrominance Cb, Cr values to identify the skin pixels depending on the shape and size of dynamically generated skin color clusters \citep{brancati:17}. The method is very efficient in terms of computational effort as well as robust in very complex image scenes.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

Perhaps this was the most iconic section I have written in this thesis. And here, first of all, I would kindly like to ask my dear Professor and advisor Roberto Hirata to excuse me for (first) summarizing the reasons that brought me to this Master's program, from a personal point of view, of course. Later, I will write down the specific reasons to choose this research topic.

When I look at the word motivation, it is impossible not to establish self-questioning such as: (i) What made you do a Master's degree in Computer Science? (ii) Why did not you pursue some other type of postgraduate course? And, of course, (iii) why did you choose this topic for the research? Responding to these questions, I must possibly bring to the reader the feeling that has moved me to this point.

I was born in a family of five siblings (seven in total) and grew up in a very poor rural zone of the countryside of Minas Gerais. I always believed that studying was the only way to change the future of my family and my own. I graduated from public high school and became a bachelor in Information Systems with a scholarship. However, I always had the dream of studying at a renowned teaching institution such as the University of SÃ£o Paulo. Partly because I would like to become a Professor, something I did for a few opportunities. That answers the first question.

I am really passionate about my profession. I have ten years of experience in software development, embedded systems and, more recently, in the semiconductor industry. I felt that something was missing in my background education. The Master's degree showed me, mainly, the magic of formal mathematics and the importance it has in fundamental areas in society such as computing, engineering, physics and others. And the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of USP played a decisive role in this respect, which answers the second question.

And last but not least, the subject of the research (third question) has been something that was attractive for us from the very beginning of the program. First, with a project on race classification in partnership with the industry. Then, with the intensification in the search for related works, with the problem of skin detection. The latter led us to the brilliant work of~\citet{brancati:17}: a new rule-based skin detection method that works in the YCbCr color space. Here, more specifically, our motivation was to propose improvements based on the hypothesis that: (1) the original rule can be reversed and, (2) human skin pixels do not appear isolated, i.e. neighborhood operations are taken in consideration.

\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:contributions}

In this work, we have done a comprehensive and detailed study of various methods of skin detection within those based on rules. On the basis of~\citet{brancati:17}, seen by us as the state of the art in this field, we created variations that brought significant improvements. In addition, we analyzed the methods in question in order to provide the researchers, practitioners, enthusiasts, and other readers with a detailed understanding of the nuances involved in those methods, such as parameter selection and optimization, through a series of quantitative experiments, as well as qualitative analysis based on our observations.

Thus, we can enumerate some of the contributions that came as a result of this research project:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implementation of three variations of the skin detection method proposed by~\citet{brancati:17} on the basis of the inversely proportional behavior of the chrominance components ($Cb$ and $Cr$) of the YCbCr color model. Furthermore, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments performed in a wide range of image datasets well-known in this field;
    \item Adapted version of the neighborhood method (8-$neighbors$ window) presented in section~\ref{sec:neighborhood_extended_method};
    \item A grid search implementation to try different combinations of trapezoids parameters in order to optimize them (if possible) and understand those who have been used so far.
\end{enumerate}

Part of our contributions was published earlier in 2018 in the \emph{Proceedings of the 13th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications - VISAPP}~\citep{faria:18}.

\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}

Skin detection is a very complex problem due the numerous similar materials with human skin tone and texture, and also because of illumination conditions, ethnicity, sensor capturing singularities, geometric variations, etc. Because it is a primary task in image processing, additional requirements as real time processing, robustness and accuracy are also desirable.

Although many advances have been observed in literature, from what we have seen until the development of this research, it is possible to say that it is not yet a completely solved problem. Basically, there are three approaches for skin detection: rule-based, machine learning based and hybrid. They differ in terms of classification accuracy and computational efficiency. In general, rule-based methods do not require a training step and they can be very competitive in terms of computational cost.

Therefore, the main objective of this research is to create or improve new methods for skin detection, according to the rule-based approach. More specifically, our main objective is to achieve improvements in the method proposed by~\citet{brancati:17} in order to reduce the false positive rate. In addition, we have other secondary objectives, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Publish articles with the results in renowned conference or journals in the area;
    \item Complete the Master's degree in three years, which includes the credits in disciplines as well as the research project and this thesis.
\end{itemize}

\section{Organization}
\label{sec:text_organization}
In this chapter we have presented the background of this work as well as the motivation, main contributions, and objectives behind it. Chapter~\ref{cap:related-work} presents other relevant research works that also addresses the problem of skin detection in several distinct  approaches. In Chapter~\ref{cap:conceitos} we provide an overview of the theoretical concepts that apply to this research. Next, in Chapter~\ref{cap:proposed-solution}, we present a state of the art skin detection method recently developed by~\citet{brancati:17}. We review the method and extend it adding more rules to enforce the constraints and seeking for a better accuracy in terms of false positive rate without hurting the performance of the original method. Then, in Chapter~\ref{cap:experimentos}, we present the evaluation of the proposed extensions along with the original method in four widely known datasets: SFA, Pratheepan, HGR, and Compaq. In addition, a
brief definition of the evaluation metrics used is shown for the sake of clarity. Finally, Chapter~\ref{cap:conclusoes} winds up this thesis by discussing our observations along the research, focused on the experimental results, and directs the readers towards future works.
